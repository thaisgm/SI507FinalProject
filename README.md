Music genre recommendation generator

This application allows users to explore genres, news pertaining to genres, recommendations from spotify, and a SQL database I created composed of albums. 
The main application is run through the user_interface() function. In order to run the application, you need the following packages: 

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import secrets
import requests
import json
import base64
import sqlite3
import webbrowser

Additionally, you need a CLIENT_SECRET and CLIENT_ID from a Spotify Developer Account, included in my final submission document.
